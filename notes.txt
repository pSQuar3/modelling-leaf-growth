how to find the newest configuration:

find the force vector

find the distanc

            iterate through each of the y values
                iterate through each block j 1:num_blocks
                    check if the floor(i/rnd(j)) > block_y(j)
                        if yes
                            increment block_y by 1
                            x coordinates can be found by j:1:(j+sz);
                            print one layer of cells spanning the jth block with block_y as y value
                        if no, then continue
                go to the next block
            go to the next layer
