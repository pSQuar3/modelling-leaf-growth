*Why are we doing this project: * We are trying to develop a simplistic model to check if we can accurately model the growth of a leaf using simple concepts of classical mechanics. In the present, we have a lot of very complicated models available in litreature that take a lot of parameters into account, and often involve solving PDEs and are computationally expensive and difficult to understand and implement.


We used the "Classical Lennard Jones potential"

Lennard jones potential has both atractive and repulsive parts

(sigma/r)^12 describes the Pauli repulsion at short distances and the (sigma/r)^6 term
describes the attractive term at long distances (dispersion force) which vanishes at
infinite distances.
